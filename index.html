				<h3>
					Understanding the topic edit day limits
				</h3>
				<p>
					Most reports include the parameters:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Limit to topics edited in the last number of days</li>
					<li>Limit to topics not edited in the last number of days</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Topic edits can be either a direct edit to the topic, such as editing the title or XML content, 
					or it could be an edit to some other metadata such as the tags associated with the topic.
				</p>
				<p>
					The "Limit to topics edited in the last number of days" will limit the topics included in the 
					report to those that have been edited in some way in the specified last number of days. For
					example, if you entered 180 for this field, the topics included in the report will have been
					edited in some way in the last 180 days.
				</p>
				<p>
					The "Limit to topics not edited in the last number of days" will limit the topics included in the 
					report to those that have not been edited in any way in the specified last number of days. For
					example, if you entered 60 for this field, the topics included in the report will not have been
					edited in any way in the last 60 days.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both these parameters can be used together to define a time span in which topics must have been edited
					in order to be included in the report.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, setting "Limit to topics edited in the last number of days" to 90 days (3 months) and 
					"Limit to topics not edited in the last number of days" to 60 days (2 months) can be thought of as requesting
					topics that were edited in a 30 day (or 1 month) window from 90 days (3 months) ago.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Understanding the "Topics Skipped" summary
				</h3>
				<p>
					Reports like <a href="/birt/frameset?__report=General/Topics_Per_Category_Per_Spec.rptdesign">
					Topics per Content Specification</a> will break down the topics by the tags assigned to them from the specified category.
				</p>
				<p>
					Topics that do not have any tags assigned to them from the specified category are skipped, which is to say that they are
					not included in the values displayed by the chart. The total number of skipped topics is listed in the summary in the 
					"Topics Skipped" field.
				</p>
				<p>
					Quite often skipped topics represent topics that have not had the appropriate tags assigned to them, so the "Topics Skipped" 
					summary is a useful field to review to identify these issues.
