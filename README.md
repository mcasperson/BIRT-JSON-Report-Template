This project uses the JSONParser from https://github.com/mcasperson/birt-jsonparser to download data from a JSON based REST API. See more details at https://github.com/mcasperson/birt-jsonparser/wiki/Getting-Started.

Make sure you set the BIRT_REST_BASE_URL Java property before trying to run the reports.
